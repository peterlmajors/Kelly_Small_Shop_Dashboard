# Kelly_Small_Shop_Dashboard
This is a final project I created for my Systems Analysis class at Fordham University. It is an R Shiny App paired with some basic CSS that allows a user to import .csv files and creates highly customizable bar charts and scatter plots for consumer, product, and order data. 

The goal of this project was to create a viable IT project for a small business. If hosted locally, this application can serve the intended business at no cost (outside of some small code maintenence) while delivering massive upside. This project's end goal was to use client data to create regression models to predict demand for project categories. This would allow the shop owner (who manufacturers her own goods) to better scale her time creating pieces and devising email campaigns. With more time and real data, true models would be simple to implement given the current layout.
