# Kelly_Small_Shop_Dashboard
Final project for my Systems Analysis class at Fordham University that utilizes a simple R Shiny Application.

The app creates a few descriptive bar charts and scatter plots for different aspects of consumer, product, and order data. 

The goal of this project was to create a viable IT project for a small business. If hosted locally, this application can serve the intended business at no cost (outside of some small code maintenence) while delivering massive upside. This project's end goal was to use client data to create regression models to predict demand for project categories. This would allow the shop owner (who manufacturers her own goods) to better scale her time creating pieces and devising email campaigns. This was my first ever R Shiny application.
